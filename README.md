# Tarkov Companion

A web app for Escape from Tarkov players: track your quests, level and faction, and see what you can work on next. Game data comes live from the free [tarkov.dev](https://tarkov.dev) JSON API.

## How to open the app

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (version 20 or newer).

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. The first time only, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the address it prints, normally <http://localhost:5173>, in your browser.

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop it.

## What is in the app

- **Dashboard**: set your player level and faction, see how many quests are completed / available / locked, and a "Next up" list of the ten available quests with the lowest level requirement.
- **Quests**: every quest in the game with trader, map, minimum level and status. Filter by trader, map, status and text, sort any column, tick quests off as you complete them, and click a quest to see its objectives, prerequisites and wiki link. Kappa-required quests carry a badge.
- **Maps**: interactive map viewer (zoom, pan, fullscreen) for every playable map, with floor switching on multi-level maps and a Satellite / Abstract style toggle where both exist. Imagery, bounds and coordinate transforms come from the open-source tarkov.dev project (see `src/data/mapConfig.json` and `src/maps/projection.ts`).
- **Item Collection, Crafts, Flea Market**: placeholders for later.
- **PvP / PvE toggle** (sidebar footer): switches which game mode's data is loaded. Progress is stored separately per mode, just like in the game.
- **Settings** (sidebar footer): export your progress to a JSON file, import it again, reset it, or force a data refresh.

Your progress is saved in the browser (localStorage), so it stays on this computer unless you export it.

## Data source

Everything comes from `https://json.tarkov.dev`:

| Document | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `/endpoints` | Catalog of endpoints, game modes and languages. Read first on every load. |
| `/{gameMode}/tasks` + `/{gameMode}/tasks_en` | Quests, objectives, prerequisites. |
| `/{gameMode}/traders` + `_en` | Trader names. |
| `/{gameMode}/maps` + `_en` | Map names. |
| `/{gameMode}/items` + `_en` | Item names, icons and flea prices. |
| `/{gameMode}/prices/{itemId}` | Flea price history (cached 5 minutes). |

The base documents do not contain readable English. Names are translation keys such as `657315ddab5a49b71f098853 name`, so the `_en` document is always fetched alongside and merged in.

Data is cached for one hour and refreshed in the background. If tarkov.dev is unreachable the app shows the error on screen and retries every minute.
